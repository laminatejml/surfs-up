### Project Overview

This project is intended to find various temperature statistics for the months of June and December. With this we should be able to determin whether or not it is feasible for W. Avy to run a surf shop all year.

### Summary

Due to the miniscule temperature disparities between June and December (71 & 74 respectively), it would appear that W. Avy will be able to attract customers with little issue if does follow through with opening a surf shop year round.
